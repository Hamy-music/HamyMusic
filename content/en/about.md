# HÄMY - Unique music beyond the mainstream

"Since childhood I have been fascinated by stories, history and the way music lets us experience different worlds and emotions. I want to bring back those feelings I had as a kid and challenge my notions of what music ‘should be.’

I aim to create experiences and memorable moments for people since I strongly believe they bring lasting happiness and joy to life.

My music is meant to be a bridge between world music and rock and I hope that by crossing this bridge, you too can take a moment to be HÄMY (meaning 'hazy') and discover something entirely new and unexpected for yourself."
