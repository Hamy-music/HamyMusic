# HÄMY - Unique music beyond the mainstream
<!--HÄMY was born from a desire to create something personal, unique, and distinct from the mainstream. Something hazy.-->

"I've been fascinated by stories, history and the way music lets us experience different worlds and emotions since childhood. I want to bring back those feelings I had as a kid and challenge my notions of what music 'should be.' 
<br>
I aim to create experiences and memorable moments for people because I strongly believe they bring lasting happiness and joy to life. 
<br>
My music is meant to be a bridge between world music and rock and I hope that by crossing this bridge, you too can take a moment to be HÄMY (meaning 'hazy') and discover something entirely new and unexpected for yourself."
