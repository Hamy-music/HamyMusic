## PERFORMANCES

### LIVE LOOP PERFORMANCE

A live-loop performance is HÄMY at its best!

Thanks to live-looping technology, the performance comes to life with a richer array of soundscapes. Looping allows multiple instruments to be "played" simultaneously and the audience gets to witness in real time how each song takes shape and reaches its final form.

<br>
Over the years live-looping has become a refined skill, mastered by only a few who can simultaneously maintain a connection with their audience while delivering an entertaining live experience. I believe I’ve achieved this balance and can offer listeners a truly unique experience! This performance style is perfect for small, medium and even very large events.

An acoustic performance is an excellent choice for smaller events.

HÄMY plays original songs acoustically on the guitar and incorporates throat singing. Past acoustic performances have been held in venues like cafés, outdoor shelters, and even smaller Viking or medieval-themed events.

During these performances, HÄMY also showcases ancient instruments and shares their history, cultural significance, and crafting techniques. This performance style is best suited for intimate and tranquil events.
